# 💛 ROOTED Wellness — People Wellness, Family Support & Aging Services

A non-clinical “people wellness” discovery vertical inside the ROOTED OS.

This repository consolidates:
- Parenting & Family Services
- Senior Services

Into a single, clean, role-guided discovery experience.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Includes:
- Parenting & caregiver programs
- Childcare resources (non-advertorial, non-marketplace)
- Family support services (non-crisis directory)
- Accessibility & mobility programs
- Senior centers and aging support resources
- Adult day programs (directory + education)
- Community meal supports
- Wellness education (non-clinical)

This vertical helps adults and caregivers find:
- services
- programs
- events
- support resources

without turning care into a marketplace.

---

## 🚫 What This Is NOT

ROOTED Wellness is NOT:
- Medical diagnosis or treatment
- Medical billing, insurance workflows, or EMR storage
- A private caregiver hiring marketplace
- A childcare gig platform / babysitting marketplace
- Surveillance, tracking, or vulnerability targeting

---

## 🧭 Vertical Identity

This vertical is:
- 💛 People-centered
- 🔐 Highly governed
- 🧒 Kids Mode aligned (but adult-facing)
- 🚫 No commercial ranking of vulnerable services
- 🧭 Public-good by default

Kids are not monitored and are not treated as entities.
Kids Mode is a safety and UI enforcement posture.

## 🧱 Structure (Clean Separation Inside One Repo)

ROOTED Wellness may present guided entry points such as:
- “Parenting & Family Services”
- “Senior Services”
- “Accessibility & Mobility”
- “Caregiver Support”
- “Programs & Events”

These are navigation and discovery routes — not separate identities.

---

## 📁 Repository Scope

Includes:
- Wellness UI surfaces
- Discovery cards and program listings
- Accessibility guidance and resource flows
- Events display surfaces (where relevant)

Does NOT include:
- Schema/RLS edits
- Payment systems for caregiving labor
- Any weakening of Kids Mode protections

Backend authority:
- `rooted-core`
- `rooted-platform/governance/`

---

## ✅ Canonical Reminder

If any implementation conflicts with:
- database enforcement (RLS / views / RPCs)
- Kids Mode governance
- sanctuary/nonprofit protections
- anti-surveillance doctrine

Then the implementation is invalid and must be corrected.
