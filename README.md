# 👨‍👩‍👧 ROOTED Parenting & Family Services — Care, Support & Local Programs

A family-focused vertical that wraps around **Kids Mode**, caregivers, and local support systems.

This vertical is for **adults & caregivers**, not for kids to navigate alone.

- Local parenting programs
- Childcare resources (non-advertorial)
- Family counseling & support services (non-crisis directory)

- 🧒 Directly aligned with Kids Mode governance (but adult-facing)
- 🛑 No “bidding” on children, no ranking by payment
- 🔐 Bound by child safety & data minimization

- Enable targeting of families based on vulnerability
- Sell or broker access to families
